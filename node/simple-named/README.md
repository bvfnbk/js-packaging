# `simple-named`

The (most) simple `node` module.

* Single file (`index.js`).
* No transpiling
  * Vanilla JavaScript
  * No cutting edge features.
  * Node-only
* Common-JS

**Please note:** The function is exported as `square`, use it as

```javascript
const {square} = require('simple-named');

const four = square(2);
```
